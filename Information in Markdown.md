A USB drive (8GB or more recommended).
An ISO file of the operating system or utility you want to install (e.g., Windows, Linux).
A tool to make the USB drive bootable.
Method 1: Using Rufus (for Windows OS)
Rufus is a popular, free tool for creating bootable USB drives. Here's how to use it:

Steps:
Download and Install Rufus:

Go to the Rufus official website and download the latest version of Rufus.
Insert the USB drive into your computer.

Open Rufus:

Open the Rufus application (no installation required if you download the portable version).
Select the USB Drive:

In Rufus, under the "Device" section, select the USB drive you want to use.
Select the ISO File:

Under "Boot selection," click "SELECT" and choose the ISO file for the OS or tool you want to make bootable (e.g., Windows 10 ISO).
Configure Partition Scheme:

For Windows, use "GPT" if your system uses UEFI; use "MBR" if your system uses legacy BIOS.
If you are unsure, you can leave the default settings.
Start the Process:

Press the "Start" button. A warning will pop up that all data on the USB drive will be erased. Confirm to proceed.
Wait for Rufus to create the bootable USB. The process might take several minutes, depending on the size of the ISO file and the speed of your USB drive.
Completion:

Once Rufus completes, the USB drive will be bootable and ready to use.
Method 2: Using UNetbootin (for Linux OS)
UNetbootin is a cross-platform tool for creating bootable USB drives, especially for Linux distributions.

Steps:
Download and Install UNetbootin:

Download UNetbootin from UNetbootin's official page.
Install or use the portable version.
Insert the USB Drive into your computer.

Open UNetbootin:

Launch UNetbootin.
Select Distribution or ISO:

You can either choose a Linux distribution from the list (UNetbootin will download it for you) or manually select an ISO file if you already have one.
Select the USB Drive:

In the "Drive" dropdown, choose the USB drive you want to use.
Start the Process:

Click "OK" and wait for the tool to create the bootable USB.
